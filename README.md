- Hi, Iâ€™m @Suav58 (Slawomir born in 58', so pretty old)
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in developing educational applications for GeoGebra and Web.
-  Iâ€™m currently learning Information Theory as well as dynamical graphics in GeoGebra. 
-  Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on short educational interactive programmes in GeoGebra.
- ðŸ“« You can find me on Twitter (now X) under, predictably, @Suav58 and we can go on from there.
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: whatever your taste
- âš¡ Fun fact: My first programme was loaded from perforated cards and run on Odra 1204 (I can't remember, but it probably was some sorting algorithm)
